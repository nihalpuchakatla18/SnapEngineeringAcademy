Nihal Puchakatla's Snap Academic's Stage 2 website

Thank you for taking your time to look my my project! This project showcases my love for video games and combining it with my coding skills!

This website lets to search for any of the 39 video games on the webpage, letting you search based on title, platform, genre or publiser of the video game. You can also sort all the games in terms of the recency or in terms of sales.
You can also click on a Game Card to see its trailer/gameplay video

Thank you again for your time, and I hope you have a great day!
